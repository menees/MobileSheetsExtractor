# MobileSheets Extractor
This was written as a one-time extractor for my [MobileSheets](https://zubersoft.com/mobilesheets/)
song database as I evaluate moving to other software like [OnSong](https://onsongapp.com/)
or [SongBook](https://www.linkesoft.com/songbook/).
It doesn't try to be generic since I'm not planning to keep it up-to-date or
to support all MobileSheets concepts, e.g., Books, Custom1 field, etc.
